# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- The JevBench adapter answers inputs up to 16,384 tokens; 0.1.0 refused anything over 4,096.
  JevBench's hard tier has policy documents of up to ~6k tokens, and the longest public prompt is
  already 4,033 tokens. Inputs past the largest CUDA graph (4,096) run the same model eagerly.
  Weights, prompt, temperature and every answer at or under 4,096 tokens are unchanged.

## 0.1.0

- First release: Qwen3.5-4B + distilled LoRA (merged), temperature 1.367, CUDA-graph runtime,
  in-process JevBench adapter and `jevk5-serve`.
